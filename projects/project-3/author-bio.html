        Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a renowned
        English writer, mathematician, logician, and photographer. He was born
        on January 27, 1832, in Daresbury, Cheshire, England, and passed away on
        January 14, 1898, in Guildford, Surrey, England. Carroll is best known
        for his imaginative literary works, particularly "Alice's Adventures in
        Wonderland" and its sequel, "Through the Looking-Glass."
        <br />It was during Dodgson's time at Oxford that he began developing
        the stories that would later become "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."
        In 1862, while on a boating trip with the Liddell family, Dodgson told a
        tale to entertain the children, including Alice Liddell. Encouraged by
        the positive reception, he later expanded the story into a manuscript,
        and it was published in 1865 under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. The
        book's whimsical characters, imaginative plot, and clever wordplay made
        it an instant success and a beloved classic of children's literature.
