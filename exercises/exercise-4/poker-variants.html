      <strong>Introduction to Variants: </strong> While Texas Hold'em is the
      most popular poker variant, the world of poker offers a diverse range of
      games. Here are a few intriguing variants to consider:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Omaha Hold'em: </strong>Similar to Texas Hold'em, but players
        receive four hole cards, and they must use exactly two of them to form
        their hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seven Card Stud: </strong>Players receive seven cards, and the
        goal is to form the best five-card hand. Betting rounds follow each card
        dealt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Five Card Draw: </strong>Each player is dealt five private
        cards, and they can exchange some or all of them for new cards in an
        attempt to improve their hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Razz: </strong>A lowball variant where the goal is to have the
        lowest possible hand. Straights and flushes don't count, and Aces are
        low.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pineapple and Crazy Pineapple: </strong>Variants of Hold'em
        where players receive three hole cards, but in Crazy Pineapple, one card
        must be discarded after the flop.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stud High-Low: </strong>A split-pot variant of Seven Card Stud
        where the highest and lowest hands share the winnings.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Conclusion: </strong>Poker is a game of skill, strategy, and
      psychology that offers endless excitement and opportunities for
      improvement. Whether you choose to start with Texas Hold'em or explore
      other variants, poker is a game that rewards dedication and practice. Join
      the poker community, sharpen your skills, and enjoy the thrill of the
      cards!
