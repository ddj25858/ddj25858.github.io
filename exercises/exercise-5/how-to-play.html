      <strong>Introduction to Texas Hold'em: </strong> Texas Hold'em is the most
      widely played variant of poker and serves as an excellent starting point
      for new players. In this game, players receive two private cards (hole
      cards), and five community cards are placed face-up on the table. The
      objective is to form the best hand using any combination of these seven
      cards.
